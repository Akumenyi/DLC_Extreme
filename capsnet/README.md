#This implementation is heavily inspired by the works of Xifeng Guo who took the burden to implement Hinton's paper. 
#Thank you Guo! For keeping the spirit of open source alive

#There are a lot of changes adapted for our own climate data but the idea of capsules remain the same

#Usage:
#Run capsnetv2.py to dump the best weights during training. Use the shell script
#Once weights are dumped run capsnetv3.py to load the best weights and run on your test case
